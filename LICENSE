# Solar Power Phone Charging Station (Dual-Axis Tracker)

A low-cost solar phone charging station with **dual-axis sun tracking**. LDR sensors drive two servos via **Arduino Uno** to keep the panel normal to the sun. Harvested energy charges **18650 Li-ion cells** and is regulated through a **DC-DC boost** to provide a stable 5 V USB (and optional wireless) output.

## Features
- Dual-axis tracking (azimuth + elevation) using 4× LDRs
- Arduino-based control with adjustable deadband & speed
- 18650 battery pack + BMS, 5 V USB output (boost converter)
- Optional Qi wireless module
- Campus-ready, portable, and eco-friendly

## Hardware
- Solar panel (~6–12 V, 5–10 W)
- 4× LDR + 4× 10 kΩ resistors (voltage dividers)
- 2× SG90/9g servos (or MG90S)
- Arduino Uno (or Nano)
- 18650 cells (with BMS), holder, wiring
- DC-DC boost to 5 V USB (and/or wireless charger board)
- Misc: mounts, frame, wires, switch, enclosure

> **Power note:** Do **not** power servos from Arduino 5 V pin. Use a separate 5 V rail (e.g., the boost output or a buck), and **tie grounds together**.

## Pin Map (default)
- LDRs: A0=A_left, A1=A_right, A2=A_up, A3=A_down  
- Servos: D9=Azimuth, D10=Elevation

## Build & Upload
1. Wire sensors/servos (see `hardware/wiring.md`).
2. Open `firmware/SolarTrackerCharger.ino` in Arduino IDE.
3. Select **Arduino Uno**, choose COM port, and upload.
4. Calibrate: tweak `DEADBAND`, `STEP`, and servo limits, then test.

## How Tracking Works
LDR pairs (left–right, up–down) form two error signals. If the difference exceeds a deadband, the corresponding servo steps to reduce the error until the panel is centered on the sun.

## Safety
- Use a proper **BMS** for the 18650 pack.
- Fuse the battery line.
- Insulate all high-current joints; verify polarity before power-up.
